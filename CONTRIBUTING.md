## How to contribute

Government employees are encouraged to contribute.

All contributors retain original copyright, but are granting a world-wide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable license to all users.  This project is covered by an [Apache v2.0 license](https://apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/int/stash/projects/DSC/repos/dsc-db/browse/LICENSE).

Currently contributions are limited to government employees with a bitbucket account. However, this project is scheduled to be made open-source and published on the BCGOV github page. Once this has happened these guidelines will change.  

For Gov employees willing to contribute, create a fork of this repo, make your changes, then create a pull request so that the changes can be vetted and merged.
